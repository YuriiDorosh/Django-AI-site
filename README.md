# Running the Django-AI-site Project 

![home_page](home_page.png)

## Clone the Repository

First, clone the project repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YuriiDorosh/Django-AI-site.git
```

## Navigate to the Project Directory

Navigate to the project directory that you just cloned:

```bash
cd Django-AI-site
```

## Create a .env File

Create a .env file in the project directory and define the required environment variables. You can use a text editor to create and edit the file. Here's an example of the contents of the .env file:

```bash
API_KEY='Your OpenAI API Key'
SECRET_KEY='Your Django Secret Key'
DEBUG=True
DB_NAME='Your Database Name'
DB_USER='Your Database User'
DB_PASSWORD='Your Database Password'
DB_HOST='db'
```

Replace the placeholders with your actual API key, secret key, database information, and any other required settings.

## 1. Running the Project Locally

Create a virtual environment (if not already created) and install project dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv  # Create a virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual environment (Linux)
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install project dependencies
```

Run the Django development server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

## 2. Running the Project with Docker

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your computer:

- Docker: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Docker Compose: [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)


Build and start the project containers using Docker Compose and the Makefile:

```bash
make docker-up
```

Access the project in your web browser at http://localhost:8000/.

To stop the project and containers, you can use:

```bash
make docker-down
```

## 3. Running the Project with Makefile (without Docker)

```bash
make run
```
